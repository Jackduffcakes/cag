              <ul style="list-style-type:none"><br><li><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">Freshman Year</span><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br><li>Keep your focus on personal development rather than the college process; take challenging courses and form positive relationships with school faculty.</li>
                <br><li>Enter high school in a growth mindset. Build intellectual curiosity. Take risks- run for club positions, try new things, make your own club, etc.</li>
                <br><li>Get involved in your school and community.</li>
                <br><li>In regards to the college process, though, consider:<ul style="list-style-type:circle"><br><li>Setting up a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.naviance.com/">Naviance</a> account if you haven’t already. You can take surveys on the site like the strengths explorer survey as well as start researching colleges.</li>
                <br><li>Looking at academic requirements for graduation, college admission, and, if you’re a student athlete, looking at the NCAA core course requirements.</li></ul>
                <br><li>Take the PSAT 8/9 in the fall.</li>
                <br><li>Meet with and get to know your guidance counselor early. Counselors have a lot of resources to offer but only if you ask.</li>
                <br><li>Tentatively plan course selection by mapping out core courses and the classes you want to take throughout high school. Be flexible to change, though. Plan to challenge yourself academically more every year.</li>
                <br><li><a id="sy"></a>Record major awards, accomplishments, and activities (do this all four years).</li></ul>

                <br><br><li><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">Sophomore Year</span><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br><li>Continue focusing on personal development, challenging yourself academically, and developing leadership skills.</li>
                  <br><li>Maintain school and community involvement and continue using your guidance counselor as a resource.</li>
                  <br><li>Consider having your parents consult with a finance professional about strategies for paying for college.</li>
                  <br><li>Take the PSAT 10 and consider studying for standardized tests if you feel you need to (<a target="_blank" href="../Standardized-Testing/index.html">SAT + ACT</a>). The summer before junior year is a good time to study for standardized tests. Try taking one practice test in the spring of sophomore year to determine how much you need to study to reach your goal score.</li>
                  <br><li>If necessary, consider what subject tests you want to take junior year and, if you feel very prepared, consider taking one this year.</li>
                  <br><li><a id="jy"></a>Schedule a challenging academic schedule for junior year; ideally more than sophomore year.</li></ul>

                <br><br><li><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">Junior Year</span><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br><li>Focus on getting good grades in your junior year (especially your <a target="_blank" href="../AP/index.html">APs</a>) as junior year can be one of the most important years academically.</li>
                  <br><li>Start preparing for college applications; consider academic interests, colleges that you feel a connection to, etc.</li>
                  <br><li>If you don’t have one then get a social security number; it is necessary for college and financial aid.</li>
                  <br><li>Identify and explore the college planning resources at your high school and through outside resources (like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402260687/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=collegeadmi00-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1402260687&linkId=8f4b68237ace7dbbcba43dd60802126b">Fiske Guide To Colleges</a>).</li>
                  <br><li>Begin narrowing down colleges that seem to be a good fit for you, and consider visiting them. When you set up official campus visits you can often receive fee-waived applications. It, also, gives the added bonus of demonstrating your interest in the college.</li>
                  <br><li>Take the PSAT/NMSQT at your school in the fall.</li>
                  <br><li>Register for the SAT I (and possibly II’s) and ACT for the fall or spring test administration dates. The earlier the better as you will have more time to study and retake; if you can finish all standardized tests before senior year you will have more time to work on your college applications.</li>
                  <br><li>Check with potential colleges on specific testing requirements. Remember that if a school ‘recommends’ SAT II’s then it is important that you take them. SAT II’s are content based and studying is almost always necessary (<a target="_blank" href="../Subject-Tests/index.html">SAT IIs/ Subject Tests</a>). Even if you excelled in the corresponding AP course there is often slightly different content or additional content on the SAT subject test.</li>
                  <br><li>Consider what teachers you want to ask for recommendation letters and inform them that you will want one. Choose teachers that know you best; consider what you excel in academically or what classes you took that you felt you showed positive character traits in that you want admissions officers to see. For example, perhaps the teacher of a class you struggled in could give good insight into how you handle challenges.</li>
                  <br><li>If there is a recommendation letter form for your high school where you put some information about yourself for the teachers writing your recommendation letters then fill that out.</li>
                  <br><li>Continue considering your/ your parents plan to finance college and become familiar with federal and private student loans if necessary.</li>
                  <br><li>Start looking into scholarship opportunities in your community and beyond.</li>
                  <br><li>When you select courses for senior year, choose CHALLENGING ones. College admission representatives take notice of this as an indicator of your motivation and true intellectual curiosity. Having a super lax schedule points towards a weak intellectual curiosity.</li>
                  <br><li>Consider a summer job or internship that may be related to a potential career interest.</li>
                  <br><li><a id="gy"></a>What you do in the summer after junior year is often important to admissions officers.</li></ul>

                <br><br><li><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px">Senior Year</span><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><br><li>Don't slack off academically. Try to get good quarter one grades and send them to any school(s) you applied early decision/ early action. Good senior grades strengthens your case for intellectual curiosity and demonstrates your work ethic. Do the same for first semester grades for your regular decision schools. Senior grades can be important when admissions officers make their decision.</li>
                  <br><li>Finish standardized tests and send in college applications earlier rather than later. Be aware of ‘priority deadlines’ or any deadlines that colleges prefer your application to be submitted by in addition to the official deadlines.</li>
                  <br><li>Have a strong <a target="_blank" href="../Constructing-Your-College-List/index.html">application strategy</a>.</li>
                  <br><li>Be aware of financial aid forms like the FAFSA.</li>
                  <br><li>Search for scholarship opportunities in your community and online.</li>
                  <br><li>If applicable, be aware of your athletic recruitment potential and how that plays in.</li>
                  <br><li>Most applications are submitted by either November or January and decisions are received by mid-April.</li>
                  <br><li><a id="sym"></a>May 1st is national college decision day.</li></ul></ul>
