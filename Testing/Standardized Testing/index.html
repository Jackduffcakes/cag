  <p>Standardized Testing</p>

<p>Take your standardized tests early, try both the ACT and SAT, and don’t forget about subject tests. Standardized tests respond very well to a practice test style of studying. This site doesn't focus too much on giving you the information you can find easily like the aforementioned (although I can supply that if need be) but rather focuses on helping you by pointing out what I see as often neglected or misunderstood in the process and in these sections by differentiating the good study books from the rest.

  <p>Is The SAT Preferred Over The ACT? I See Ivies Accept More Students Who Take The SAT!</p>

    <p>No. The SAT is simply more popular on the East Coast and more kids from the East Coast apply to the Ivy League schools. </p>

    <p>Schools With All Scores Policies</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This is something I see students fretting about far more than they should. University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Yale and several other schools require all test scores to be submitted while Cornell requires all SAT tests but not ACT. You can look up the score policies of the colleges you are considering.</p>

    <p>Do not let this deter you from applying to a school. </p>
    <p>Even if you have an abysmally low test score, it will only show diligence and motivation for you to have raised it. After all, raw intelligence rarely trumps diligence and a strong work ethic. These schools understand that students are not perfect. Don’t take any standardized tests for fun or not seriously and don’t take a content-based subject test without studying at all (Bio, Chem, Physics, etc), but do not let a suboptimal first SAT score deter you from applying to these schools either.</p>

    <p>The ‘Once You Hit A Certain Score It Doesn’t Matter’ Myth</p>
  </div>
</a>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>It can be comforting to believe that every test score above "X" is equal (X is often around a 1400 SAT or 30 ACT). What is really meant by that is that at "X" your score is likely not a major <span style = "font-style: italic"> weakness</span>.
    <p>Improving your standardized test score continues to strengthen your application and chances no matter where you are at.</p>
    <p>That being said, a 10-50 point increase on the SAT or 1 point increase on the ACT, is not going to change your chances dramatically. So, if you do get, say, a 35 ACT, or 1550+ SAT then work on strengthening the other parts of your application rather than grinding for a very small advantage.</p>
    <p>Allocate your time efficiently.
      <div class = "container">
      <img src = "chalkboard.jpg" width = 100% height= 100%><div class = "chalk"><p>Don’t fall into the trap of ‘every score above "X" is the same,’ because it is not. Know when, though, to stop trying to increase your score.</p></div></img>
      </div>


    <p><span style = "font-weight: bold">If your score is near perfect, you have already studied a significant amount, or you have taken the standardized test 3+ times, then you should be spending time strengthening the other parts of your application.</span></p>
    <p>Don’t get hung up on your test score. Do your best and understand where that situates you, but be optimistic; after all, most students won’t know all of these intangibles and nuances like you will.</p>

    <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school.</p>
