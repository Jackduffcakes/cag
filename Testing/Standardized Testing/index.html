<div class = "content">
  <p> This section focuses on differentiating the good study books from the rest and points out some misconceptions about standardized tests. A few quick tips, though, for your standardized tests:</p>
  <ul id = "a">
    <li id = "b">Take your standardized tests early, ideally at the beginning of Junior year or end of Sophomore year, so that you have time to study and retake.</li><br>
    <li id = "b">Try both the ACT and SAT as scores can sometimes be drastically different between the two tests based on the individual.</li><br>
    <li id = "b">Donâ€™t neglect subject tests; be prepared to take them at the end of Junior year at the latest.</li><br>
    <a id = "satact"><li id = "b">One of the best ways to practice for Standardized Tests is through practice testing. Take multiple practice tests and carefully go over the answers you get wrong (and right because you don't know if it was luck or for the wrong reasons).</li></a>

<p>I'd recommend buying this book along with either the Princeton Review or Barron's depending on what score you are going for. This book is made by the official ACT test makers and the practice tests are real ACT tests. Don't bother with the newer version of this book, though, as it adds very little and is much more expensive.</p>

    <p>While on the subject of calculators, I recommend buying a good calculator for school as well. The Ti-nSpire is a great investment as it makes courses like AP Stat or AP Calc more manageable.</p>
    <p>The nSpire has some more useful functions and a more useful interface than its predecessors (Ti-89 etc).</p>
    <p>One thing to be aware of is that CAS (computer algebra system) calculators are only allowed to be used on the SAT and not the ACT.</p>
    <p>That being said, the Ti-nspire CX CAS Graphing Calculator is the newest calculator and has the most functional capabilities; the CAS can be incredibly useful for everyday math class.</p>

  <p>Is The SAT Preferred Over The ACT? I See Ivies Accept More Students Who Take The SAT!</p>

    <p>No. The SAT is more popular on the East Coast and more kids from the East Coast apply to the Ivy League schools. </p>

    <p>Schools With All Scores Policies</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This is something I see students fretting about far more than they should. University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Yale and several other schools require all test scores to be submitted while Cornell requires all SAT tests but not ACT. You can look up the score policies of the colleges you are considering.</p>
    <p>Do not let this deter you from applying to a school. </p>
    <p>Even if you have an abysmally low test score, it will only show diligence and motivation for you to have raised it. After all, raw intelligence rarely trumps diligence and a strong work ethic. These schools understand that students are not perfect. Donâ€™t take any standardized tests for fun or not seriously and donâ€™t take a content-based subject test without studying at all (Bio, Chem, Physics, etc), but do not let a suboptimal first SAT score deter you from applying to these schools either.</p>

    <p>The â€˜Once You Hit A Certain Score It Doesnâ€™t Matterâ€™ Myth</p>

  <div class = "content">
    <p>It can be comforting to believe that every test score above "X" is equal (X is often around a 1400 SAT or 30 ACT). What is really meant by that is that at "X" your score is likely not a major <span style = "font-style: italic"> weakness</span>.
    <p>Improving your standardized test score continues to strengthen your application and chances no matter where you are at.</p>
    <p>That being said, a 10-50 point increase on the SAT or 1 point increase on the ACT, is not going to change your chances dramatically. So, if you do get, say, a 35 ACT, or 1550+ SAT then work on strengthening the other parts of your application rather than grinding for a very small advantage.</p>
    <p>Allocate your time efficiently.

    <p>Donâ€™t get hung up on your test score. Do your best and understand where that situates you, but be optimistic; after all, most students wonâ€™t know all of these intangibles and nuances like you will.</p>
