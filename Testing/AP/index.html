    <p>If you are aiming for top schools or even if you aren’t, hopefully you have selected a challenging course load. </p>
    <p>Not all AP Courses are equally difficult. It depends on what your abilities are, but APs like AP Human Geography tend to be easier than APs like AP Physics or AP Chemistry. I can provide my evaluation of the tiers of difficulty of the AP courses if frequently requested, but I am very hesitant to do so. Your course choices should be based on what interests you; you’ll do better in the class and it well help foster your intellectual curiosity. It should not be based on what might be ‘easier.’</p>
    <p>Another thing about AP tests that I was disheartened to find out is that AP tests are not weighted very highly in the eyes of admissions officers. I found the AP tests to be a large focus for me throughout my high school career, and it is certainly good to do well on them, but AP scores are often more of a boost or weakness to your application than an influential factor. So, don’t stress too much about imperfect AP scores.</p>
    <p>Still, particularly if you end up at a college that offers credit for AP scores- getting good AP scores is very helpful.</p>
