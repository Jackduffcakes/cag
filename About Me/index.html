    <p>About Me</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p> My name is Jack Duffy. I decided to create this site after observing friends and peers just as academically qualified as me fail to get in to top schools for not understanding the nuances and hidden factors behind admissions.</p>
    <img class = "fri" style = "width: 17%; margin-left: 10px;" src = "me.JPG"></img>
    <p>I got into an Ivy League School, Dartmouth College, from the 80% of academically qualified. Nothing I did was extraordinary and I am not a recruited athlete, ‘hooked’ applicant (minority, first generation, legacy, low income, etc) and wasn't in the top 1% of my public high school.</p>
    <p>Dartmouth accepts <a href = "https://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2017/03/2092-students-are-offered-admission-class-2021">10% of applicants</a>. They differentiate through the intangibles.</p>
    <p>I realized the way I approached the admissions process wasn’t as common as I had previously thought. The time spent analyzing and understanding these nuances and intangibles could then be of much more value in the hands of others helping them get into college.</p>
    <p>I am an 18 year old graduating high school senior in the PA area. Entering Dartmouth come fall I am unclear on my major, but entrepreneurship is interesting to me. My parents both went to an average college and my brother graduated from Cornell University in 2017.</p>
    <p>I say all this only to establish that I am not extraordinary. I just have learned a lot about the admission process.</p>
    <p>I love to help people so feel free to contact me. </p>
    <p>If people are interested I can give my personal stats for the application process (grades, test scores, etc), but really that won’t be too helpful for any of you.</p>
    <p>If you like the content I provide donating is very helpful, for even though I am not doing this for money, I can’t be spending tons of time on here if I am making no money at all.</p>
    <p>Thank you for checking out my content and for your interest in me. </p>

  <p>Donating is not required or expected; it allows me to continue putting a lot of work into the website, though, and help those going through the college process.</p>
