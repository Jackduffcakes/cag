    <p>About Me</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p> My name is Jack Duffy. As I stated earlier this website is really just my analysis of the process and me doing the research that I don’t believe people should have to do. </p>

    <p>I realized only recently that the way I approached the process wasn’t as common as I thought; I realized then that all the time I spent analyzing and understanding these nuances and intangibles could be of so much more value in the hands of others helping them get into college.</p>

    <p>I am an 18 year old graduating high school senior in the PA area. Entering Dartmouth come fall I am unclear on my major, but I do know that I love strategy and entrepreneurship is interesting to me. My parents both went to a fairly average college in Iowa and my brother graduated from Cornell University in 2017.</p>

    <p>I say all this only to establish that I am not extraordinary. I just understand the admission process really well.</p>

    <p>I love to help people and so feel free to contact me. </p>

    <p>If people are interested I can give my personal stats for the application process (grades, test scores, etc), but really that won’t be too helpful for any of you.</p>

    <p>If you like the content I provide donating is very helpful, for even though I am not doing this for money, I can’t be spending tons of time on here if I am making no money at all.</p>

    <p>Thank you for checking out my content and for your interest in me. </p>

  <p>Donating is not required or expected; it allows me to continue putting a lot of work into the website, though, and help those going through the college process.</p>

    <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school. I will simply advise and facilitate your application to the best of my ability.</p>
