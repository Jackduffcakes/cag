  <p>Everyone has something unique and different to offer. The general tips only get you so far and are more helpful for understanding some of the hidden nuances, but only you know what your strongest or most desirable trait is. Determining what that is (and it isnâ€™t limited to just one thing) and showcasing it is crucial to constructing a cohesive and compelling college application. </p>

  <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school. I will simply advise and facilitate your application to the best of my ability.</p>
