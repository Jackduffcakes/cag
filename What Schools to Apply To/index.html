  Constructing Your List of Colleges
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>Here I must stress the importance of carefully selecting your college list. This is intuitive, but I can’t tell you how many times students will say that they don’t want to go to a school they got into because it’s too urban, big, hot, etc. </p>

<p>Every school you apply to you need to be at least okay with going. If you aren’t then that school isn’t even useful as a safety.</p>

<p>You also need to be realistic with your choices. Capitalizing on all of these intangibles still probably won’t get you accepted if your standardized test scores or grades aren’t in the range of students who are accepted. Be optimistic but don’t be unrealistic (if you are an ‘unhooked’ applicant for example you really should shoot to be in the top 25% or above average stat wise- grades and test scores). </p>

<p>I can’t talk about all the schools you will be looking at. Thus I will recommend what I think is the most comprehensive guide to explaining all the different colleges. It is invaluable to be able to simply flip to a page and learn more than enough about that college. </p>

    The ‘System’ To Your List
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This is also something that I think many people are aware of, but something that I must stress. </p>

  <p>The college application structure of ‘safeties, just-rights, reaches’ of years past tended to be a lot of safeties, some just-rights, and one or two reaches. It resembled something like this:</p>


  <img src = "AntiquatedTriangle.png" class = "antiquated-triangle" />



  <p>This idea is now antiquated and is essentially flipped:</p>


  <img src = "NewTriangle.png" class = "new-triangle" />
  </p>

  <p>A lot of reaches are applied to, and only one or two safeties. The reasons for this change are primarily due to the ease at which applying to college can now be done (through the common app) and the increased selectivity of colleges particularly top colleges (effectively making top schools a reach for everyone even those beyond outstanding). Applying to schools is much easier now than it was in years past and this makes top students applying to 15 colleges not out of the norm. This only makes the schools more selective in accepting applicants. It also explains the rising importance of demonstrated interest for colleges- even top schools (see ‘Demonstrated Interest’ for more). </p>

  <p>The subjectivity of the college process due to the weighing of all these intangibles makes the admissions more ‘arbitrary’ if you will so applying to more schools (more of the selective ones) is crucial to maximize your chances.</p>
</div>
  <div class = "title">
    Your Schools
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>When you decide what schools to apply to be realistic but optimistic. If your grades and test scores fall at or below the bottom 25% of the school and you are not a recruited athlete, applying there is a reach at best (and more likely is simply a mistake); you can use that time to apply to a school where you have a reasonable chance at acceptance. I can help give you an idea of what a safety, just-right, or reach school would be for you in 'Personal Guidance,' but it is important that you use your guidance counselor and look at the grades and testing statistics of schools before you construct your list. Understand that some of the statistics at top schools are brought down by recruited athletes or other special applicants. Be realistic with your choices, but still aim high (that's why I suggest applying to a lot of reaches and just-rights).</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "title">
    School History
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This is another factor that is actually very influential for your chances- past acceptances from the college for your high school (and thus the relationship that the college has with your high school). </p>

  <p>To start to explain this I will give an example of something that occurs at my high school. Cornell University has taken around two students from my high school every year for a while now. With my class it was no different with Cornell choosing to take two Early Decision admits out of a pool of six applicants.  Why does Cornell do this?</p>

  <p>Cornell knows my high school very well and, so, they don’t have to do research on my school’s profile and uncommon 7 point GPA weighting system when they look at applicants from my school. Past applicants from my high school have done very well at Cornell and, so, Cornell can feel secure that my high school produces students who can handle Cornell’s academics fairly well (my brother, class of 2013, got into Cornell and held a high GPA, made the Dean’s list, etc. as well as other applicants that I know). So because of all this Cornell makes it easy on themselves and generally takes about two kids from my public school each year (one year nobody from my school applied to Cornell and the Cornell admission officer called my school to question why nobody applied). Cornell is a very selective school; this is a great example of school history making it easier for applicants to a particular college to get in.</p>

  <p>This is, of course, an anecdotal example  (and much of this for you will have to be observation based and there is certainly room for error so be careful in evaluating this), but this trend can be seen throughout. My school never sends anyone to Harvard despite having sent multiple to Princeton, Columbia, Yale, and Stanford. It is because my highschool is not on Harvard’s radar at all and they don’t feel like learning about it. You see this with many high schools who will send students every year to a particular highly selective school but have no students ever get into a particular less selective school. </p>

  <p>I know a lot about my particular high school and the advantage of school history (and I may consider going into detail about this for students from my high school at some point). This is something that I would very much recommend you do research on for your high school (usually you can check Naviance data or things like that). It really can be either a lot harder or a lot easier to get into a school based on how past applicants from your school have fared (mainly in getting accepted but also sometimes how they did at the college as well). </p>

  <p>That being said, it would be a great thing for your school for you to pave the way for future applicants to get into an elite college by you, yourself, being accepted despite the school’s history! </p>

  </div>
  <div class = "title">
    Location
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>Although I hate to talk about something out of your control (which is why I don’t talk about race because, although it is often an influencing factor, it is not in your control), location is relevant in that you can be at an advantage or disadvantage applying to certain schools based on your location.</p>

<p>The obvious advantage lies in applying to schools that offer cheaper tuition to in-state residents and being an out of state resident (ie: the college will get more money from you). The basic premise though of capitalizing on location is applying to schools that people from your location don’t often apply to. So a great example is applying to the UC’s from my public school in PA. UC Berkeley is widely considered a very selective school but if you look at my school's acceptance data you see students with lower stats being accepted. This is because so few applicants come from PA and PA applicants are paying such expensive tuition. </p>

<p>So, this basic premise applies throughout. Applying to a small Pennsylvania school from California is going to give you an advantage in acceptance, as will applying to Duke from Montana, etc.</p>

<p>I must stress though that this location factor really should not be taken too heavily; it is merely situationally advantageous but not something to base your college decisions off of especially if it means reluctantly going far away from home. </p>

    <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school. I will simply advise and facilitate your application to the best of my ability.</p>
