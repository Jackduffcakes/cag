    Logic Flaws
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This section is perhaps the one that I neglected the most throughout the application process and this resulted in some unnecessary anxiety, waste of time, and likely had a negative effect on the strength of my application.</p>

  <div class = "title">
    Be Wary of College Forum Sites and Comparing Yourself to Others
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>College forum sites (like College Confidential, for example) are situationally useful but are often unreliable and can be fairly toxic for both their content and what their content is used for. </p>

    <p>Using college forum sites to compare yourself to students who post on the admission result page for a specific college is not a good idea. It is impossible to compare yourself to these applicants when they only release the information they feel like releasing to you on the site. They can be embellishing their accomplishments or understating them. Comparing what you think your application ‘strength’ is to theirs is simply a waste of time (I understand that admission officers have to compare applications to a certain extent but it doesn’t help you to try and do so). Taken from personal experience, I perused these decision threads fairly obsessively; it doesn’t help. Likewise engaging in these types of comparisons with peers is just as detrimental.</p>

    <p>Don’t use the forum sites to gauge a school’s selectivity based off of these admission result threads or really any other content on the site besides the school's legitimate acceptance rate, testing statistics, etc. I have seen fraudulent postings of these stats on these sites (I even had kids telling me about completely inaccurate acceptance rates that they didn’t realize were fraudulent that they found on these sites), so really it is best to go to a more legitimate website to ascertain these statistics- the college’s website itself, Prep-Scholar (I wouldn’t recommend this site for anything more but they are fairly accurate with statistics), the Fiske Guide, etc. </p>

    <p>The college forum sites aren't even that useful for figuring out what the students are like at the college or what the atmosphere is like. Students at that college are not going to waste their time going on college forum sites to post about this, so often the people that do post are still in high school or are strange helicopter parents that think they know a lot about colleges and the college process. If you want to know about the school’s culture or students visit their website or better yet visit the campus and see for yourself.</p>

    Justifying Weaknesses
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>This, as well as ‘undermining accomplishments,’ are logic flaws that I see occurring on forum sites all the time and can be instigated by the excessive perusing of these sites. </p>

    <p>I’ll use an example of what I see occurring on the sites but this logic flaw is definitely not limited to online forums.</p>

    <p>The questions I see constantly posted by people are something to the likes of “Can I get into (insert Ivy/ top school) with a (insert mediocre GPA) or (mediocre test score) or (mediocre subject test score), etc.” To which people will reply “Of course you can! People get in with (insert whatever mediocre thing they had).” And those people are not wrong at all, but the problem is that students then become content with those weakness and have multiple mediocre points; they then unreasonably think they have decent chances because of these constant affirmations of each of their mediocre stats. When in reality, yes, one can have a mediocre stat here or there, but the rest of the application then has to be stellar and a list of mediocre stats will not give you a chance at a top school.</p>

    <p>This is intuitive, certainly, but it is one so many fall victim to. Don’t justify the weaknesses in your application, address them, work on them if you can, or if you can’t- then understand how that situates you with regards to your chances at specific colleges.</p>

    Undermining Accomplishments
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>I also see students doing essentially the complete opposite. They peruse forum sites and see the decision threads with these students posting boastful information, not stating their weaknesses, etc and see these students say they got rejected and hence incorrectly overestimate the selectivity of the school.</p>

    <p>It can be very easy to undermine your accomplishments and fixate on your perceived weaknesses of your application. Understand that nobody has a perfect application and the students who do get into Ivy League schools really are just good, smart students, who capitalized on  the intangibles (either accidentally or on purpose) and showed their desirable traits effectively. Yes there are superstars who get in, but most students really are just good, genuine students who show that that is exactly what they are.</p>

    <p>Just find a balance of optimism but realism when applying to schools. One of the worst things you can do, though, is undermine your accomplishments on your application. There is a fine line between being humble and disqualifying all of your great achievements as simply run of the mill achievements. This balance is hard to achieve but achieving it is crucial to constructing a compelling application. If you are too boastful you will be rejected for being perceived as cocky and ingenuine but too humble and you will be rejected for being unqualified and not impressive enough.</p>
