    What Is This Website?
  </div>
    <div class = "content">
      <p>
        On this site I highlight many examples of neglected and well-hidden aspects of the college application process that will give you, cumulatively, a sizeable advantage in the application process. In 2017/2018 80+% of kids who apply to Ivy League schools, other top schools (Little Ivies,etc), and really most schools with acceptance rates below 60% are academically qualified. That means colleges choose between kids with similar GPA’s, scores, and often times extracurriculars. How do they choose?</p>
	<p>There are intangibles that are often highly neglected in student’s applications that colleges look for. Things like intellectual curiosity, kindness, and other traits are crucial and really are the differentiating factors between the kid with a 4.0 and 1480 SAT getting accepted over another with a 4.0 and 1480.</p>

<p>I can show you how to best showcase and leverage the traits that you possess that are the most desirable to admission officers. I can help you understand other key nuances of the admission process, as well, to better situate you for both acceptance and for bigger merit aid packages.

I got into Dartmouth College despite the process becoming more and more nuanced and selective. Nothing I did was extraordinary and I am neither a recruited athlete nor ‘hooked’ applicant (minority, first generation, low income, etc) nor was I even in the top 1% of my public highschool.</p>

<p>I just happened to showcase these vital traits effectively through my application.</p>

<p>Dartmouth accepts 10% of applicants and as quoted from one of their admission officers ‘80-85% of applicants are academically qualified for admittance and success at Dartmouth College.’ They differentiate through these intangibles.</p>

<p>I see kids work hard all through high school only to neglect to show these desired qualities to the college they apply to.
I see people pay an exorbitant amount of money on 'admission professionals' or ‘admission experts.’ </p>

<p>Let me help you. All content on this site is free (even personal guidance) but visiting, and sharing this website will incentivize me to make more free content to help you and others applying to college.

      What Can You Even Offer?
      <div class = "content">
        <p>
          I think strategically and have a tendency towards excess. As I went through the college application process in 2017 I became obsessed with learning the nuances of the process. I wanted to know how admission officers at top schools choose between applicants whose grades and scores are all stellar. Some  of these intangibles I was aware of throughout the process but some I began to understand more thoroughly in hind-sight. </p>
          <p> Analyzing the admission results of those around me, it saddened me when I saw people just as academically competent as me or others accepted to top schools fail to get in because they didn't understand all these nuances and hidden factors. It is thus my goal to educate you on these aspects. I offer insight into the parts of the process that aren't as straightforward; the admission process has and continues to fascinate me and I hope to leverage this fascination and propensity for strategic analysis to help you through your application process.

      Site Structure
      <div class = "content">
        <p>
          This site is still being developed. New content will constantly be added as I continue to research the process so that students going through the process don't have to. Please excuse any technical or aesthetic errors (still learning coding). The site will be constantly reorganized (planning for drop down tabs with subcategories eventually) and buffed with additional content.
        </p>
        <p> Here is the current layout, suggested order, and content summary as well as upcoming content (feel free to let me know if you are interested in the upcoming content or if you want me to address something else).</p>

  <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school. I will simply advise and facilitate your application to the best of my ability.</p>
