      <p> "the great majority of students who are admitted stand out from the rest because a lot of little things, when added up, tip the scale in their favor" <br>&emsp;<a href = "https://admissions.yale.edu/what-yale-looks-for" style = "font-family: serif; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.6vw; font-style: normal;">-Yale Admission Website</a><p></div>
      <div class = "underquote">
             <p>This rhetoric is seen throughout top schools (less than 40% acceptance rates).
             <br>These ‘little things’ are the focus of this site. <br>They differentiate students.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "content">
      <p><br>
        In 2017 80+% of students who apply to top schools are academically qualified. Colleges choose between students with similar GPA’s, scores, and often times extracurriculars. How do they choose?</p>
	<p>Beyond grades and scores lie the intangibles that admissions officers look for. Traits like intellectual curiosity and kindness, are often the differentiating factors between the student with a 4.0 and 1480 SAT getting accepted over another with a 4.0 and 1480.</p>

  <p>This website shows you how to showcase and leverage the traits that you possess that are the most desirable to admissions officers. </p></div>
  <div class = "container"><img id = "uni" src = "mit.jpg"></img><div class = "centertext">This site, unlike most college admissions sites, explores the non-obvious. It focuses on the factors beyond grades, scores, and extra-curriculars that translate to acceptance and bigger merit aid packages.</div></div>
  <div class = "content">
  <p>I got into an Ivy League School, Dartmouth College, from that 80% of academically qualified. Nothing I did was extraordinary and I am neither a recruited athlete nor ‘hooked’ applicant (with a compelling major factor in admission ie: minority, first generation, legacy, low income, etc) nor was I even in the top 1% of my public high school.</p>

<p>Dartmouth accepts 10% of applicants. They differentiate through these intangibles.</p>

<p>I see students work hard all through high school only to neglect to show these desired qualities to the college they apply to. They fail to understand these nuances and, so, become one of the many 'academically qualified' rejects. </p>

<p> I hope to provide access to all of the important information on the inexact factors in college admissions.</p>

    <div class = "title">
      <p>What Can You Even Offer?</p>
      <div class = "content">
        <p>I think strategically. As I went through the college application process in 2016 I became obsessed with learning the nuances of the process. I wanted to know how admissions officers at top schools choose between applicants whose grades and scores are all stellar. Some  of these intangibles I was aware of throughout the process but some I began to understand more thoroughly in hind-sight. </p>
        <p> Analyzing the admission results of those around me, it saddened me when I saw friends and peers just as academically competent as me or others accepted to top schools fail to get in because they didn't understand all these nuances and hidden factors. </p>
        <p>It is my goal to educate you on these aspects. I offer insight into the parts of the process that aren't as straightforward; the admission process has and continues to fascinate me and I hope to leverage this fascination to help you through your application process.</p>

      <div class = "content">
        <p>
          This site is still being developed. New content will constantly be added as I continue to research the process so that students going through the process don't have to. The site may also be constantly reorganized.
        </p>

        <p>The tabs are in the order that I think they would optimally be viewed in.</p>

  <p>This is my view of the college application process. I do not know everything nor do I claim to be right 100% of the time. I simply wish to help people by supplying my analysis of the process but it should be taken in conjunction with people in your life like guidance counselors, teachers, etc. I assume no responsibility for getting you into any particular school.</p>
