    <p>All of the content I provide is not sufficient as your only resource throughout your college process. My site covers the intangibles well, but does not suffice as a resource for deciding on specific colleges, planning your major, etc. </p>
    <p>I will recommend some resources that can be very useful depending on what you are looking for.</p>

    <p>College Forum Sites</p>
  </div>
  <div class = "content">
    <p>College forum sites (like <a href = "http://www.collegeconfidential.com/">College Confidential</a>, for example) can be useful when used with a healthy amount of skepticism. It is a forum site so you have to be careful to not take every post as fact or true. Still, though, it gives access to a lot of students, parents, and guidance professionals; some posts can be very helpful and informative.</p>
    <p>It is nice to hear actual students' and professionals' experiences and opinions of different colleges. You will come across individual biases, but this is nullified with enough opinions and posts. It can function as a good supplementary resource or as a means to ask specific questions, and along with guidance professionals and other resources it can help you during the college process.</p>
